# A higher level definition of the bytecode interpreter

## Abstract

The CPython interpreter is defined in C, meaning that the semantics of the
bytecode instructions, the dispatching mechanism, error handling, and
tracing and instrumentation are all intermixed.

This document proposes defining a custom C-like DSL for defining the 
instruction semantics and tools for generating the code deriving from
the instruction definitions.

These tools would be used to:
* Generate the main interpreter
* Generate the tier 2 interpreter
* Generate documentation for instructions
* Generate metadata about instructions, such as stack use.

Having a single definition file ensures that there is a single source
of truth for bytecode semantics.

Other tools that operate on bytecodes, like `frame.setlineno`
and the `dis` module, will be derived from the common semantic
definition, reducing errors.

## Motivation

The bytecode interpreter of CPython has traditionally been defined as standard
C code, but with a lot of macros.
The presence of these macros and the nature of bytecode interpreters means
that the interpreter is effectively defined in a domain specific language (DSL).

Rather than using an ad-hoc DSL embedded in the C code for the interpreter,
a custom DSL should be defined and the semantics of the bytecode instructions,
and the instructions defined in that DSL.

Generating the interpreter decouples low-level details of dispatching
and error handling from the semantics of the instructions, resulting
in more maintainable code and a potentially faster interpreter.

It also provides the ability to create and check optimizers and optimization
passes from the semantic definition, reducing errors.

## Rationale

As we improve the performance of CPython, we need to optimize larger regions
of code, use more complex optimizations and, ultimately, translate to machine
code. 

All of these steps introduce the possibility of more bugs, and require more code
to be written. One way to mitigate this is through the use of code generators.
Code generators decouple the debugging of the code (the generator) from checking
the correctness (the DSL input).

For example, we are likely to want a new interpreter for the tier 2 optimizer
to be added in 3.12. That interpreter will have a different API, a different
set of instructions and potentially different dispatching mechanism.
But the instructions it will interpret will be built from the same building
blocks as the instructions for the tier 1 (PEP 659) interpreter.

Rewriting all the instructions is tedious and error-prone, and changing the
instructions is a maintenance headache as both versions need to be kept in sync.

By using a code generator and using a common source for the instructions, or 
parts of instructions, we can reduce the potential for errors considerably.


## Specification

> This specification is at an early stage and is likely to change considerably.

Syntax
------

Each op definition has a kind, a name, a stack and instruction stream effect,
and a piece of C code describing its semantics::
 
```
  file:
    (definition | family)+

  definition:
    kind "(" NAME "," stack_effect ")" "{" C-code "}"
    |
    kind "(" NAME ")" "=" uop ("+" uop)* ";"
    |
    kind "(" NAME ")" "{" C-code "}"
 
  kind:
    "inst" | "op" | "super"

  stack_effect:
    "(" inputs? "--" outputs? ")"

  inputs:
    input ("," input)*

  outputs:
    output ("," output)*

  input:
    object | stream | array

  output:
    object | array

  uop:
    NAME | stream

  object:
    NAME [":" type] [ "if" "(" C-expression ")" ]

  type:
    NAME

  stream:
    NAME "/" size

  size:
    "1" | "2" | "4"

  array:
    object "[" NAME "]"

  family:
    "family" NAME = NAME ("," NAME)+ ";"
```

The `kind` must be one of:

* `inst`: A normal instruction, as currently defined by `TARGET(NAME)` in `ceval.c`.
* `op`: A part instruction from which other ops and instructions can be constructed.
* `super`: A super-instruction, such as `LOAD_FAST__LOAD_FAST`.

`NAME` can be any ASCII identifier that is a C identifier and not a C or Python keyword.
`foo_1` is legal. `$` is not legal, nor is `struct` or `class`.

The optional `type` in an `object` is the C type. It defaults to `PyObject *`.
The objects before the "--" are the objects on top of the the stack at the start
of the instruction. Those after the "--" are the objects on top of the the stack
at the end of the instruction.

The third form of `definition` is a transition form to allow the original C code 
definitions to be copied. It lacks information to generate anything other than the
interpreter, but is useful for initial porting of code.

The number of `#`s in a `stream` define how many codeunits are consumed from the
instruction stream. It returns a 16, 32 or 64 bit value.

The name `oparg` is pre-defined as a 32 bit value fetched from the instruction stream.

The C code may include special functions that are understood by the tools as
part of the DSL.

Those functions are:

* `DEOPT_IF(cond)`. Deoptimize if `cond` is met.
* `ERROR_IF(cond, handler)`. Jump to error handler if `cond` is true.
* `PEEK(n)`. The `n`<sup>th</sup> item on the stack, which is not pushed.
  (`PEEK(1)` is the top of the stack.)

Variables can either be defined in the input, ouput, or in the C code.
Variables defined in the input may not be assigned in the C code.
If an `ERROR_IF` occurs, all values will be removed from the stack.
If a `DEOPT_IF` occurs, no values will be removed from the stack or
the instruction stream.

Semantics
---------

The underlying execution model is a stack machine.
Operations pop values from the stack, and push values to the stack.
They also can look at, and consume, values from the instruction stream.

All members of a family must have the same stack and instruction stream effect.

Examples
--------

Some examples:
```
    inst ( LOAD_FAST, (-- value) ) {
        value = frame->f_localsplus[oparg];
        Py_INCREF(value);
    }

    super ( LOAD_FAST__LOAD_FAST ) = LOAD_FAST LOAD_FAST ;

    op ( CHECK_OBJECT_TYPE, (owner type_version/2 -- owner) ) {
        PyTypeObject *tp = Py_TYPE(owner);
        assert(type_version != 0);
        DEOPT_IF(tp->tp_version_tag != type_version);
    }

    op ( CHECK_HAS_INSTANCE_VALUES, (owner -- owner) ) {
        PyDictOrValues dorv = *_PyObject_DictOrValuesPointer(owner);
        DEOPT_IF(!_PyDictOrValues_IsValues(dorv));
    }

    op ( LOAD_INSTANCE_VALUE, (owner, index/1 -- null if (oparg & 1), res) ) {
        res = _PyDictOrValues_GetValues(dorv)->values[index];
        DEOPT_IF(res == NULL, LOAD_ATTR);
        Py_INCREF(res);
        null = NULL;
        Py_DECREF(owner);
    }

    inst ( LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE_VALUE ) = 
        counter/1 CHECK_OBJECT_TYPE CHECK_HAS_INSTANCE_VALUES
        LOAD_INSTANCE_VALUE unused/4 ;

    op ( LOAD_SLOT, (owner, index/1 -- null if (oparg & 1), res) ) {
        char *addr = (char *)owner + index;
        res = *(PyObject **)addr;
        DEOPT_IF(res == NULL, LOAD_ATTR);
        Py_INCREF(res);
        null = NULL;
        Py_DECREF(owner);
    }

    inst ( LOAD_ATTR_SLOT ) = counter/1 CHECK_OBJECT_TYPE LOAD_SLOT unused/4;

    inst ( BUILD_TUPLE, (items[oparg] -- tuple) ) {
        tuple = _PyTuple_FromArraySteal(items, oparg);
        ERROR_IF(tuple == NULL, error);
    }

    inst ( PRINT_EXPR ) {
        PyObject *value = POP();
        PyObject *hook = _PySys_GetAttr(tstate, &_Py_ID(displayhook));
        PyObject *res;
        if (hook == NULL) {
            _PyErr_SetString(tstate, PyExc_RuntimeError,
                                "lost sys.displayhook");
            Py_DECREF(value);
            goto error;
        }
        res = PyObject_CallOneArg(hook, value);
        Py_DECREF(value);
        ERROR_IF(res == NULL);
        Py_DECREF(res);
    }

    family(load_attr) = LOAD_ATTR, LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE_VALUE, LOAD_SLOT ;
```

Generating the interpreter
==========================

The generated C code for a single instruction includes a preamble and dispatch at the end
which can be easily inserted. What is more complex is ensuring the correct stack effects
and not generating excess pops and pushes.

For example, in `CHECK_HAS_INSTANCE_VALUES`, `owner` occurs in the input, so it cannot be
redefined. Thus it doesn't need to written and can be read without adjusting the stack pointer.
The C code generated for `CHECK_HAS_INSTANCE_VALUES` would look something like:

```C
    {
        PyObject *owner = stack_pointer[-1];
        PyDictOrValues dorv = *_PyObject_DictOrValuesPointer(owner);
        DEOPT_IF(!_PyDictOrValues_IsValues(dorv));
    }
```

When combined ops together to form instructions, temporary values should be used,
rather than popping and pushing such that `LOAD_ATTR_SLOT` would look something like:

```C
    case LOAD_ATTR_SLOT: {
        PyObject *s1 = stack_pointer[-1];
        /* CHECK_OBJECT_TYPE */
        {
            PyObject *owner = s1;
            uint32_t type_version = read32(next_instr + 1);
            PyTypeObject *tp = Py_TYPE(owner);
            assert(type_version != 0);
            if (tp->tp_version_tag != type_version) goto deopt;
        }
        /* LOAD_SLOT */
        {
            PyObject *owner = s1;
            uint16_t index = *(next_instr + 1 + 2);
            char *addr = (char *)owner + index;
            res = *(PyObject **)addr;
            if (res == NULL) goto deopt;
            Py_INCREF(res);
            null = NULL;
            Py_DECREF(owner);
            if (oparg &1) {
                PyObject *null = NULL;
                stack_pointer[0] = null;
                stack_pointer += 1;
            }
            s1 = res;
        }   
        next_instr += (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4);
        stack_pointer[-1] = s1;
        DISPATCH();
    }
```

Other tools
===========

From the instruction definitions we can generate the stack marking code used in `frame.set_lineno()`,
and the tables for use by disassemblers.
