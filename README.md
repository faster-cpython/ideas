# Faster CPython Ideas

Discussion and work tracker for Faster CPython project.

New ideas should be created as new [issues](https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/issues/new/choose).  It is ok if the idea is not fully formed -- we treat them as discussions to arrive at something actionable.  (We had previously used discussions for this, but that is now deprecated).

The [CPython issue tracker](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues) should be used for actual work-in-progress. 

Some links to presentations and other preliminary documentation:

- [Guido's slides at the 2021 Python Language Summit](FasterCPythonDark.pdf)
- [Mark's slides explaining Tiers of Execution](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_cvQUwO2WWsaySyCmIy9nj9by4JKnkbiPCqtluLP3Mg)
- [PEP 659](https://peps.python.org/pep-0659/)

## Published Results

Benchmarking and pystats results are published to the [benchmarking-public repo](https://github.com/faster-cpython/benchmarking-public).
